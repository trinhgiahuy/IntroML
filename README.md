# IntroPatternandMachineLearning
-----
The Famous Four - Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple - and many other hi-tech companies desperately look for the best AI engineers. Essentially by Artificial Intelligence (AI) they mean people who can seamlessly solve problems using Machine Learning (ML) techniques - methods that learn from data. ML is another form of programming and today it is an essential skill for every EE and IT engineer!

During this course you will learn some of the most fundamental techniques of machine learning (also called as pattern recognition in some texts). You will also learn how to implement them in practice and how to use them to solve engineering problems.
